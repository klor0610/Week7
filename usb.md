### Customizing Your USB
_(this is my take on the assignment)_ 

I am assuming "customize your USB" means the Debian based OS we downloaded. So to change up my Ubuntu display, I decided that I wanted to add virtual desktops to help with organization on future projects. To do this, you will need to use your web browser and terminal. 

1. click link to download gnome extensions https://extensions.gnome.org/

2. click "Click here to install browser extension", select "Allow","Add", and then "Ok"

3. click on the "wiki page" link to find your OS versions install command for gnome extensions. Open a terminal.
If you have Ubuntu, enter:      
>sudo apt-get install chrome-gnome-shell

4. in the terminal, update again if needed
>sudo apt udate 

5.now download the gnome tweak tool and exit the terminal
>sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool 

>exit 

6. click link to install "Workspaces to Dock" or you can search the extentions.gnome.org for "Workspaces to Dock". You can install by first switching the switch to "ON" and then selecting "Install"
>https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/427/workspaces-to-dock/ 

7. The workspaces should populate to the right of the screen automatically. If you cannot see the workspace to the right of your screen, move all your tabs to the left and the workspace should appear as below.

8. Right click on the grey boxed number on your workspace and select "Extension Preferences" from the menu

9.On the General tab, under the title Background, I changed the Opacity to 33.

10.Switch to the Behavior tab and turn off the "Intellihide" to hide the Workspace Extension. Then exit to save changes.

11. You can now open the Tweaks app and under "Extensions" you can see Workspaces to Dock has been added to the list and switched "ON"
